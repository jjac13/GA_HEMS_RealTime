# GA_HEMS
This library contains a set of functions to model of a multi-carrier network of a household (space heating and electric loads), and a multi-objective genetic algorithm home energy management system (HEMS), considering: a PV, solar collectors, thermal storage, a HP and a battery storage system. Created by: Joel Alpízar-Castillo.

The FLEXINET project was carried out with a Top Sector Energy subsidy from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, carried out by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO).The specific subsidy for this project concerns the MOOI subsidy round 2020.
